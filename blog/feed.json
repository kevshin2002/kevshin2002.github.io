That defeats the whole point of blogging. Blogging is supposed to showcase to whoever is visiting my site to see the raw and unfiltered person of who I am.</p>\n<p>It's been a busy two weeks, juggling classes, finals, projects, looking for new grad opportunities, and learning some new stuff on the side. The new stuff is what this blog post is about, specifically, my introduction to linux.</p>\n<p>Everybody hears linux and immediately thinks that person must be hardcore programmer or a hacker. I've come to find out that it's mainly two types of people: people who want to understand their computer and people who want to brag that they use linux.</p>\n<p>I like to think that I fit the former as one of my life long interests is to be a lifelong learner. This means understanding what I'm working with, even though I may not necessarily require it.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"why-you-may-ask\">Why you may ask?<a href=\"https://kevshin2002.github.io/blog/introduction-to-linux#why-you-may-ask\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Why you may ask?\" title=\"Direct link to Why you may ask?\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Many may say that you don't need to understand how your car works if your whole purpose is to get from point A to point B, and I agree with that. My reasoning is that I don't want to be just a driver, but an engineer.</p>\n<p>What if my car broke down in the middle of the road? Having a basic understanding of how a car functions can save you time and money instead of relying on someone else. It is also my core belief that knowing diverse sectors of technology can help make better informed decisions. We take inspiration from mother nature, so why can't we take inspiration from different fields?</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"arch-linux\">Arch Linux<a href=\"https://kevshin2002.github.io/blog/introduction-to-linux#arch-linux\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Arch Linux\" title=\"Direct link to Arch Linux\">​</a></h3>\n<p>You might be wondering what linux distro I selected, and it's probably not a surprise that it's Arch Linux. The only reason why I chose this was because of how popular it was, meaning that there would be some sort of community support for it. It turned out to be right because Arch Wiki is one of the main leading reasons why Arch is used. It's also because you have more freedom in Arch than more common distros such as Ubuntu.</p>\n<p>There are various trade offs such as having to configure packages individually, setting up your environment, getting hardware drivers that matches, and many more. This means that if ANYTHING went wrong, it was basically your fault. This is kind of an extreme way to learn linux (surface level) but it was fine since I had a windows OS on my SSD. I could just dual boot into my windows if my arch linux messed up and redo the entire setup again.</p>\n<p>I'm not going to claim that I did everything on my own, and frankly speaking, I did ask LLMs for help. I wasn't going to spend my time reading documentation which in hindsight, I should have since most of the answers were on there. This isn't a tutorial on how to set up arch linux, so I won't be going into it. The biggest challenge though was perhaps figuring out how to configure my NVIDIA graphics card to work with the distro but I got that figured out using <code>nvidia-drm</code>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"workspace\">Workspace<a href=\"https://kevshin2002.github.io/blog/introduction-to-linux#workspace\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Workspace\" title=\"Direct link to Workspace\">​</a></h3>\n<p>My next biggest challenge was to figure out what DE to use and how I wanted my workspace set up. I know I said I installed arch linux for the freedom, but I'm a big fan of not reinventing the wheel. I opted to just take someones dotfiles online and that's precisely what I did. I initially had KDE and Plasma set up, but after stumbling upon Hyprland, I was mesmerized by the aesthetics. I took the dotfiles provided by <a href=\"https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ML4W</a> and configured some of them to fit my workflow.</p>\n<p>I did a bunch of configurations and honestly enjoy how my workflow is set up. For my software workflow , I configured lazygit/lazydocker for easier use of git/docker in CLI. For anything IDE/terminal related, I configured neovim with <code>nvim-dap</code>.</p>\n<p>To be truthful, at the time I am writing this, I am doing a water fast until the academic quarter starts, and do not have the energy to be writing this. So I will stop and just showcase my workflow below. Images and GIFs portray a thousand words.</p>\n<iframe width=\"90%\" height=\"360px\" src=\"/assets/medias/workflow-36211429edfd91260d1f09815d3f3f8b.mp4\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" title=\"Workflow Video\"></iframe>",

It summed up perfectly why I decided on a website this format.</p>\n<iframe width=\"680\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xSBGYoS6z68?si=NyfMsAe4IG4YhT-4\" title=\"Why You Struggle to Follow Through (Thinkers vs Doers)\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\"></iframe>\n<p>Since you probably don't want to watch all 26 minutes of the video, I'll summarize it below.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"overview\">Overview<a href=\"https://kevshin2002.github.io/blog/thoughts#overview\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Overview\" title=\"Direct link to Overview\">​</a></h3>\n<p>How is it that some people are just better than others? Some might say talent or skill, but it's actually just continued exposure. You might ask think that if it's so simple, why is everyone so average?\nIt could do with various factors such as socioeconomics and lack of opportunity, but the fundamental reason is that most of us lose interest over time in the things we do.</p>\n<p>So how do we combat this? Well, the video discusses the 4 different phases in developing an intrinsic motivation for the things we do.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"triggered-situational-interest\">Triggered Situational Interest<a href=\"https://kevshin2002.github.io/blog/thoughts#triggered-situational-interest\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Triggered Situational Interest\" title=\"Direct link to Triggered Situational Interest\">​</a></h3>\n<p>This is the first stage of developing our interest, and it's actually just our curiosity. We can't intentionally create curiosity within ourselves and is something that we can't artificially create.\nAt this stage, we might try to learn more about the topic. If it's advanced academia, we might read a book on it, or if it's cooking, we might try following a recipe. It's the phase where we survey out for more external exposure to the topic.</p>\n<p>What's important here is that negative feedback can actually crush our confidence. Since we're new to the topic, negative feedback can hurt our curiosity and make us not pursue it. It's like watering a newly ignited torch.\nSome people attribute negative feedback at this stage as the Dunning-Kruger effect.</p>\n<img src=\"https://kevshin2002.github.io/assets/ideal-img/dunning-kruger.0a2af83.500.jpg\" width=\"960\" alt=\"Dunning Kruger\">\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"maintained-situational-interest\">Maintained Situational Interest<a href=\"https://kevshin2002.github.io/blog/thoughts#maintained-situational-interest\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Maintained Situational Interest\" title=\"Direct link to Maintained Situational Interest\">​</a></h3>\n<p>This is the phase where we want to maintain our interest by being around with people, examples, and other external exposures of the topic. It's really not different than a continuous tab on the interest topic. This is the code equivalent of read a book on the topic.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"emerging-individual-interest\">Emerging Individual Interest<a href=\"https://kevshin2002.github.io/blog/thoughts#emerging-individual-interest\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Emerging Individual Interest\" title=\"Direct link to Emerging Individual Interest\">​</a></h3>\n<p>This is the phase where we want to do internal reflections and theory craft. Theory crafting can mean how you can improve or see modifications of said topic. In cooking, you can ask how you can cook x in y way with z ingredients.</p>\n<p>The more we theory craft, the more we actually wanna do more of it. The important part is that if we only pursue external knowledge and not do anything intrinsic, we won't change. This is the stage where we want to actually apply the knowledge we've learned and learn from the mistakes.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"well-developed-individual-interest\">Well Developed Individual Interest<a href=\"https://kevshin2002.github.io/blog/thoughts#well-developed-individual-interest\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Well Developed Individual Interest\" title=\"Direct link to Well Developed Individual Interest\">​</a></h3>\n<p>At this stage, you can understand the theory crafting of someone else. You can understand how someone arrived at this conclusion or how someone made that analysis. You can jump into something and understand what's going on.\nIt's actually at this stage that feedback is the most significant. Early feedback can squash any confidence but feedback here can help in theory crafting because you know factually and logically some of the ins and outs of the topic.</p>\n<p>This is what most people often do as they'll do something advanced and not understand anything. It's oftentimes best to start from the foundations and start beginning.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7\" id=\"relation-to-website\">Relation To Website<a href=\"https://kevshin2002.github.io/blog/thoughts#relation-to-website\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Relation To Website\" title=\"Direct link to Relation To Website\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Now that I've summarized the video for you, let's talk about how it relates to my personal website. I'm quite young, and at the time of writing this, I'll be turning 23 in April. I know for sure that the decades ahead of me will be full of learning, challenges, and opportunities.</p>\n<p>I want to document this journey on my website as well as showcase all of the cool things I've done. In fact, it's actually a challenge to keep a tab on one of my interest each day and write about it. If you see this a few years, heck even a few decades, I hope that my journey has matched what I've ambitioned.</p>\n<p>My blog is also unfiltered and showcases the raw humane me. This means that I won't be censoring, modifying, prettying up any of my thoughts (asides from grammar). The reason is that so much of social media has \"processed content\", and I want to step away from that and give you genuine blogs like as if you were talking to me.</p>",
