I've gone through a significant change ever since the last time I wrote. To be fair, I was in the last quarter of my 5th year trying to find a job. I really needed a job because honestly, I didn't have anywhere to go back to.

During these past months, I was very fortunate to have been able to interview at several companies, making it to the final round for most of them. I had my hopes up for one company, but that too turned out as a rejection. I learned some valuable things along the way, which was that workers are just pawns. There should be no loyalty and if given the opportunity, you should realistically change companies for a better work life balance. That's not to say all companies are terrible, but we live in a capitalist society where once our value to the company isn't needed, we're disposed of.

Applying to jobs wasn't the only thing I did. Alongside applying for jobs, I still took graduate courses and applied for two graduate schools: UC Berkeley and UC San Diego. I only applied for these two because they're involved in the Indy Autonomous Challenge. I wanted to continue working on robotics and autonomous vehicles as my dream company was Tesla, now Intrinsic/Waymo. I didn't get into UC Berkeley, but I was fortunately accepted into UC San Diego.

I got the news around mid April, and ever since then, I've had an insane amount of energy to tackle everything with enthusiasm. I'm involved in Triton AI and Triton Droids, and even talking to research labs to join their projects over the summer (The reason why I'm staying is because I didn't get an internship unfortunately). I am still learning how to manage my grad life balance, but I've already been taking graduate classes this past year and I didn't have good study habits. Now, since I really want to take my graduate studies seriously, I'm studying and working on robotics probably 80% of my day. It's not stressful but it can sometimes be overwhelming.

I'm currently taking 4 classes: ECE276B, ECE285 (VISION), ECE275A, and Math180B. 276B is the next series course from 276A which I took last quarter, and 276B covers path planning while 276A was about sensing and estimation. It's quite interesting and is a foundational course I'll need if I want to pursue working on robotics and autonomous vehicles. 285 as the title suggests is a deep learning computer vision course, and I'm catching up on significant changes that took place in the field. I took the undergraduate version a year ago, and the latest at the time were vision transformers. Now, they're a thing of the past and are built as the base model. 275A is parameter estimation which is just trying to estimate parameters for a given data distribution. 180B is stochastic processes and is just for my math minor.

I will admit, I really didn't understand any of these concepts a year ago, but now, after having taken several graduate courses and being exposed to the same concepts and actually studying them, I'm starting to understand them. I'm actually really happy and glad that I get to pursue my masters at UC San Diego as there are so many amazing faculties and courses here. If all goes well, I may end up working at AVL through my interactions with Seth and Jason (This is the goal!).

I'm still working on learning how to actually write a blog but for now, this'll suffice. I hope to whoever reading this that it wasn't stressful. I try to make these blogs as if I'm talking to someone. I'm trying to write at the end of the day everyday mainly to add content to my website (also the github contributions shows up nicely).

Anyways, enough of my chit chat and hope to see you tomorrow! If I don't write anything, it means I forgot and was busy.
