Blogging is supposed to showcase to whoever is visiting my site to see the raw and unfiltered person of who I am.\\n\\nIt\'s been a busy two weeks, juggling classes, finals, projects, looking for new grad opportunities, and learning some new stuff on the side. The new stuff is what this blog post is about, specifically, my introduction to linux.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nEverybody hears linux and immediately thinks that person must be hardcore programmer or a hacker. I\'ve come to find out that it\'s mainly two types of people: people who want to understand their computer and people who want to brag that they use linux.\\n\\nI like to think that I fit the former as one of my life long interests is to be a lifelong learner. This means understanding what I\'m working with, even though I may not necessarily require it.\\n\\n### Why you may ask?\\n\\nMany may say that you don\'t need to understand how your car works if your whole purpose is to get from point A to point B, and I agree with that. My reasoning is that I don\'t want to be just a driver, but an engineer.\\n\\nWhat if my car broke down in the middle of the road? Having a basic understanding of how a car functions can save you time and money instead of relying on someone else. It is also my core belief that knowing diverse sectors of technology can help make better informed decisions. We take inspiration from mother nature, so why can\'t we take inspiration from different fields?\\n\\n### Arch Linux\\n\\nYou might be wondering what linux distro I selected, and it\'s probably not a surprise that it\'s Arch Linux. The only reason why I chose this was because of how popular it was, meaning that there would be some sort of community support for it. It turned out to be right because Arch Wiki is one of the main leading reasons why Arch is used. It\'s also because you have more freedom in Arch than more common distros such as Ubuntu.\\n\\nThere are various trade offs such as having to configure packages individually, setting up your environment, getting hardware drivers that matches, and many more. This means that if ANYTHING went wrong, it was basically your fault. This is kind of an extreme way to learn linux (surface level) but it was fine since I had a windows OS on my SSD. I could just dual boot into my windows if my arch linux messed up and redo the entire setup again."},{"id":"thoughts","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/thoughts","editUrl":"https://github.com/kevshin2002/kevshin2002.github.io/tree/main/blog/2024/12/7.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2024/12/7.mdx","title":"Purpose of Website","description":"So today, while finishing up my documentations for my ECE 148 class at UCSD, I ended up getting stumbled away and watching a video about putting thoughts into motion.

It summed up perfectly why I decided on a website this format.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<iframe\\n  width=\\"680\\"\\n  height=\\"315\\"\\n  src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xSBGYoS6z68?si=NyfMsAe4IG4YhT-4\\"\\n  title=\\"Why You Struggle to Follow Through (Thinkers vs Doers)\\"\\n  frameborder=\\"0\\"\\n  allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\"\\n  referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\"\\n  allowfullscreen\\n></iframe>\\n\\nSince you probably don\'t want to watch all 26 minutes of the video, I\'ll summarize it below.\\n\\n### Overview\\n\\nHow is it that some people are just better than others? Some might say talent or skill, but it\'s actually just continued exposure. You might ask think that if it\'s so simple, why is everyone so average?\\nIt could do with various factors such as socioeconomics and lack of opportunity, but the fundamental reason is that most of us lose interest over time in the things we do.\\n\\nSo how do we combat this? Well, the video discusses the 4 different phases in developing an intrinsic motivation for the things we do.\\n\\n### Triggered Situational Interest\\n\\nThis is the first stage of developing our interest, and it\'s actually just our curiosity. We can\'t intentionally create curiosity within ourselves and is something that we can\'t artificially create.\\nAt this stage, we might try to learn more about the topic. If it\'s advanced academia, we might read a book on it, or if it\'s cooking, we might try following a recipe. It\'s the phase where we survey out for more external exposure to the topic.\\n\\nWhat\'s important here is that negative feedback can actually crush our confidence. Since we\'re new to the topic, negative feedback can hurt our curiosity and make us not pursue it. It\'s like watering a newly ignited torch.\\nSome people attribute negative feedback at this stage as the Dunning-Kruger effect.\\n\\n<img src={DunningKruger.src} width=\\"960\\" alt=\\"Dunning Kruger\\" />\\n\\n### Maintained Situational Interest\\n\\nThis is the phase where we want to maintain our interest by being around with people, examples, and other external exposures of the topic. It\'s really not different than a continuous tab on the interest topic. This is the code equivalent of read a book on the topic.\\n\\n### Emerging Individual Interest\\n\\nThis is the phase where we want to do internal reflections and theory craft. Theory crafting can mean how you can improve or see modifications of said topic. In cooking, you can ask how you can cook x in y way with z ingredients.\\n\\nThe more we theory craft, the more we actually wanna do more of it. The important part is that if we only pursue external knowledge and not do anything intrinsic, we won\'t change. This is the stage where we want to actually apply the knowledge we\'ve learned and learn from the mistakes.\\n\\n### Well Developed Individual Interest\\n\\nAt this stage, you can understand the theory crafting of someone else. You can understand how someone arrived at this conclusion or how someone made that analysis. You can jump into something and understand what\'s going on.\\nIt\'s actually at this stage that feedback is the most significant. Early feedback can squash any confidence but feedback here can help in theory crafting because you know factually and logically some of the ins and outs of the topic.\\n\\nThis is what most people often do as they\'ll do something advanced and not understand anything. It\'s oftentimes best to start from the foundations and start beginning.\\n\\n### Relation To Website\\n\\nNow that I\'ve summarized the video for you, let\'s talk about how it relates to my personal website. I\'m quite young, and at the time of writing this, I\'ll be turning 23 in April. I know for sure that the decades ahead of me will be full of learning, challenges, and opportunities.\\n\\nI want to document this journey on my website as well as showcase all of the cool things I\'ve done. In fact, it\'s actually a challenge to keep a tab on one of my interest each day and write about it. If you see this a few years, heck even a few decades, I hope that my journey has matched what I\'ve ambitioned.\\n\\nMy blog is also unfiltered and showcases the raw humane me. This means that I won\'t be censoring, modifying, prettying up any of my thoughts (asides from grammar). The reason is that so much of social media has \\"processed content\\", and I want to step away from that and give you genuine blogs like as if you were talking to me."}]}}')}}]);
