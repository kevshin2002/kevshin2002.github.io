## Getting Started

These are my notes from the ROS2 Navigation course available on [The Construct](https://app.theconstruct.ai). As this is a robotics note, you will need physical hardware components to follow along.Before each section though, I will list what is required before starting.

## Map

A map is a representation of the environment that the robot is functioning in. It uses the map to localize and plan trajectories. Maps are implemented in ROS2 via an occupancy grid where in each ccell, specific values represent obstacles.

### Requirements

Before starting, we need a robot with LIDAR and Odometry. We also need to use SLAM for localizing. Available ones are cartographer and SLAM-Toolbox. This note uses cartographer as the learning curve is lower. It is notable that cartographer is no longer maintained, so the better software to use is SLAM-Toolbox.

Cartographer is a system that provides real-time simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in both 2D and 3D across multiple platforms and sensor configurations. Cartographer_ros is a ROS wrapper of cartographer so that we can integrate cartographer with ROS. This allows us to use prebuilt packages and only have to configure them.

![cartographer_2d](https://google-cartographer-ros.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/demo_2d.gif)

### Configuring Cartographer

We use a launch file because we can start multiple nodes and can also set a node-specific parameter while launching a node. These parameters can then be loaded from a YAML file or specified in the launch file.

To launch `cartographer`, we need to launch two nodes:

```py
import os
from ament_index_python.packages import get_package_share_directory

cartographer_config_dir = os.path.join(get_package_share_directory('cartographer_slam'), 'config')

Node(
    package='cartographer_ros',
    executable='cartographer_node',
    name='cartographer_node',
    output='screen',
    parameters=[{'use_sim_time': True}], # boolean indicating node synchronization time with simulation time
    arguments=['-configuration_directory', cartographer_config_dir,
               '-configuration_basename', configuration_basename]
    # configuration_directory specifies where the configuration files are
    # configuration_basename specifies the configuration file name
    ),
Node(
    package='cartographer_ros',
    executable='cartographer_occupancy_grid_node',
    output='screen',
    name='occupancy_grid_node',
    parameters=[{'use_sim_time': True}],
    arguments=['-resolution', '0.05', '-publish_period_sec', '1.0']
    # resolution specifies number of meters per grid in the map
    # publish_period_sec specifies frequency of publishing to /map topic
    )
```

We then create a LUA file named `cartographer.lua` within the config directory.

```lua
include "map_builder.lua"
include "trajectory_builder.lua"

options = {
  map_builder = MAP_BUILDER,
  trajectory_builder = TRAJECTORY_BUILDER,
  map_frame = "map",
  tracking_frame = "base_footprint",
  published_frame = "odom",
  odom_frame = "odom",
  provide_odom_frame = false,
  publish_frame_projected_to_2d = true,
  use_odometry = true,
  use_nav_sat = false,
  use_landmarks = false,
  num_laser_scans = 1,
  num_multi_echo_laser_scans = 0,
  num_subdivisions_per_laser_scan = 1,
  num_point_clouds = 0,
  lookup_transform_timeout_sec = 0.2,
  submap_publish_period_sec = 0.3,
  pose_publish_period_sec = 5e-3,
  trajectory_publish_period_sec = 30e-3,
  rangefinder_sampling_ratio = 1.,
  odometry_sampling_ratio = 1.,
  fixed_frame_pose_sampling_ratio = 1.,
  imu_sampling_ratio = 1.,
  landmarks_sampling_ratio = 1.,
}

MAP_BUILDER.use_trajectory_builder_2d = true

TRAJECTORY_BUILDER_2D.min_range = 0.12
TRAJECTORY_BUILDER_2D.max_range = 3.5
TRAJECTORY_BUILDER_2D.missing_data_ray_length = 3.0
TRAJECTORY_BUILDER_2D.use_imu_data = false
TRAJECTORY_BUILDER_2D.use_online_correlative_scan_matching = true
TRAJECTORY_BUILDER_2D.motion_filter.max_angle_radians = math.rad(0.1)

POSE_GRAPH.constraint_builder.min_score = 0.65
POSE_GRAPH.constraint_builder.global_localization_min_score = 0.7

-- POSE_GRAPH.optimize_every_n_nodes = 0

return options
```

Make sure that within setup.py, we specify the new config and lua directories. If you're using C++, make sure to specify the DIRECTORIES within CMakeList.

```py
(os.path.join('share', package_name, 'launch'), glob('launch/*.launch.py')),
(os.path.join('share', package_name, 'config'), glob('config/*')),
```

```cpp
install(DIRECTORY
    launch
    config
    DESTINATION share/${PROJECT_NAME}/
)
```

We can then compile the package and launch the launch file. We can then run rviz2 on another terminal while this is running.

To display our mapping, add the `map` display and set the topic to `/map`. If the mapping isn't showing, then the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters of the `/map` may be wrong. We can add a couple more displays.

- `TF`: Allows us to see the frames of the robot
- `LaserScan`: Allows us to see the laser coliding with the objects on the map

These are all specific to the hardware configurations the construct provides

After moving and mapping around, we'll have our entire domain.

### Different Configurations

Cartographer works for many robots and sensors but must be configured properly to work optimally. By default, cartographer automatically subscribes to `/scan, /odom, /imu` topics. All configurations can be given from the Lua configuration file.This means that in the launch files, we have to remap those three if we want to publish data to them.

```py
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch_ros.actions import Node

def generate_launch_description():
    return LaunchDescription([
        Node(
            package='cartographer_ros',
            executable='cartographer_node',
            name='cartographer',
            remappings=[
                ('/scan', '/my_laser_scan'),
                ('/odom', '/my_odom'),
                ('/imu', '/my_imu')
            ]
        )
    ])
```

If we want to save the map that we mapped out, we can run an executable named `map_saver` from `nav2_map_server`. It's important that we call this within the directory that we want to save the map in. The cartography has to be running for this to work.

```bash
ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f <name>
```

This'll generate two files of type `.pgm and .yaml`. The `.pgm` is an image file of the map as an occupancy grid image. The `.yaml` contains details about the resolution of the map.

Example:

```yaml
image: turtlebot_area.pgm
mode: trinary
resolution: 0.05 # Resolution of the map (meters/pixel)
origin: [-3.8, -1.84, 0] # Coordinates of the lower-left pixel on the map (x,y,z). The third value indicates rotation and if there is none, value is 0
negate: 0 # Inverts the color of the map.
occupied_thresh: 0.65 # Pixels with a value greater than this value will be considered an occupied zone
free_thresh: 0.25 # Pixels with a value smaller than this will be considered a completely free zone
```

### Using Saved Map

If we want to use this saved map, we have to launch `map_server` and `nav2_lifecycle_manager`. We can create a custom launch file for this, but we must specify some parameters.

```py
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch_ros.actions import Node
frmo ament_index_python.packages import get_package_share_directory
import os

def generate_launch_description():
    map_file = os.path.join(get_package_share_directory('map_server'), 'config', 'turtlebot_area.yaml')
    return LaunchDescription([
        Node(
            package="nav2_map_server",
            executable="map_server",
            name="map_server",
            output="screen",
            parameters=[{'use_sim_time': True}, # Boolean indicating if map_server must synchronize with its time with the simulation
                        {'yaml_filename':map_file] # The complete path to the map yaml file
            ),
        Node(
            package="nav2_lifecycle_manager",
            executable="lifecycle_manager",
            name="lifecycle_manager_mapper",
            output="screen",
            parameters=[{'use_sim_time': True},
                        {'autostart': True}, # lifecycle manager autostart when launched
                        {'node_names':  ['map_server']}] # Nodes that the lifecycle manager takes care of
            )
        ])
```

We can try using our saved map by creating a ROS2 package called map_server, placing our saved map files inside of config, and creating our launch file. Note that we can just put our launch file in any package and just create a new launch file with our configs.

:::info
You must specify your map display durability as Transient Local. Volatile means use incoming data being published as the map source, while transient local allows us to check if we had any cached messages that were published but not received by our subscriber as well as all incoming data.

## Nav2 Lifecycle Manager

Navigation nodes are managed nodes meaning that they can be easily controlled to be restarted, paused, or running. They can do so by being at these states:

- Unconfigured
- Inactive
- Active
- Finalized

The diagram is taken from the course and depicts how nodes transition from one state to another. Seems to be like a state machine.
![Node Transition](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/notebooks.ws/ros2-navigation-humble-148/images/lifecycle.png)

Managed nodes start at the `unconfigured` state and is active usually when running. To transition to `active`, nodes need an external agent that moves them to this state. Several nodes in Nav2, such as `map_server`, `amcl`, `planner_server`, and `controller_server`, are lifecycle enabled meaning they are managed nodes.

These nodes have the required overrides of the lifecycle functions:

- on_configure()
- on_activate()
- on_deactivate()
- on_cleanup()
- on_shutdown()
- on_error()

#### Lifecycle Manager

In Nav2, the external agent that helps transition nodes to an active state is called the `nav2_lifecycle_manager`. The lifecycle manager changes the state of the managed nodes to achieve a controlled startup, shutdown, reset, pause, or resume of the navigation stack.

Referenced from Steve Macenski

![Figure](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/notebooks.ws/ros2-navigation-humble-148/images/diagram_lifecycle_manager.png)

Nav2 uses a wrapper of `LifecycleNode`, the `nav2_util LifecycleNode` and it hides many abstractions of LifecycleNodes for typical applications. It includes a bond connection for the `lifecycle manager` to ensure that after a node transitions up, it also remains active. When a node crashes, it lets the `lifecycle manager` know and transitions down the system to prevent a critical failure.

The `nav2_lifecycle_manager` provides a ROS service from which other ROS nodes can invoke the startup, shutdown, reset, pause, or resume functions. Based on these requests, the `nav2_lifecycle_manager` calls the necessary lifecycle services in the managed nodes. As shown previously in the `nav2_lifecycle_manager` node within the launch file, we specify which nodes need management via `node_names`. The ordering matters as that is the order in which they have to be moved to initialized (first to last) and the order in which they are paused and stopped (last to first).

It's important that the manager has the `autostart` parameter which allows the `nav2_lifecycle_manager` to do it's default behavior.

You interact with the `nav2_lifecycle_manager` via a service named:

```bash
/<lifecycle_manager_node_name>/manage_nodes

ros2 service call /lifecycle_manager/manage_nodes nav2_msgs/srv/ManageLifecycleNodes "{command: 0}" # Start the nodes
ros2 service call /lifecycle_manager/manage_nodes nav2_msgs/srv/ManageLifecycleNodes "{command: 1}" # Pause the nodes
ros2 service call /lifecycle_manager/manage_nodes nav2_msgs/srv/ManageLifecycleNodes "{command: 2}" # Resume the nodes
ros2 service call /lifecycle_manager/manage_nodes nav2_msgs/srv/ManageLifecycleNodes "{command: 3}" # Reset the nodes
ros2 service call /lifecycle_manager/manage_nodes nav2_msgs/srv/ManageLifecycleNodes "{command: 4}" # Shutdown the nodes
```

This is because the service `/manage_nodes` uses the message `nav2_msgs/srv/ManageLifecycleNodes` which is as follows:

```txt
uint8 STARTUP = 0
uint8 PAUSE = 1
uint8 RESUME = 2
uint8 RESET = 3
uint8 SHUTDOWN = 4

uint8 command
---
bool success
```

## Localization

Localization is knowing the current position with respect to the environment. This means knowing the position and orientation. This is otherwise known as the pose.

ROS has a very robust algorithm for localization. It uses `AMCL` which is the Adaptive Monte-Carlo Licalization and uses a probabilistic localization system for a robot moving in 2D. It implements the adaptive or KLD sampling Monte Carlo localization approach which uses a particle filter to track a robot's pose against a known map.

**A ROS Robot is localized when somebody publishes a transform between the `/map` frame and the `/odom` frame**

That means that the `/odom` frame of the robot knows its relative position to the `/map` frame. Therefore, the robot knows its position on the map since `/base_link` frame is directly connected to the `/odom` frame.

When everything is correct, the AMCL publishes that transform.

### ROS2 Localization

In order to localize, we need three nodes:

- `map_server`: provides the map to the localization algorithm
- `localization`: the algorithm
- `life cycle manager`: state manager

Let's create an `ament_cmake` package and the launch file for all three nodes.

```py
from ament_index_python.packages import get_package_share_directory
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch_ros.actions import Node
import os

def generate_launch_description():
    nav2_yaml = os.path.join(get_package_share_directory('localization'), 'config', 'amcl_config.yaml')
    map_file = os.path.join(get_package_share_directory('map_server'), 'config', 'turtlebot_area.yaml')
    print(map_file)
    return LaunchDescription([
        Node(
            package="nav2_map_server",
            executable="map_server",
            name="map_server",
            output="screen",
            parameters=[{'use_sim_time': True}, {'yaml_filename': map_file}] ## This is the saved map we got from our cartography.
            ),
        Node(
            package="nav2_amcl",
            executable="amcl",
            name="amcl",
            output="screen",
            parameters=[nav2_yaml]
            ),
        Node(
            package="nav2_lifecycle_manager",
            executable="lifecycle_manager",
            name="lifecycle_manager",
            output="screen",
            parameters=[{'use_sim_time': True},
                        {'autostart': True},
                        {'node_names': ['map_server', 'amcl']}]
            )
        ])
```

The amcl_config specifies the configurations for the localization algorithm. This goes inside of the config directory of your package.

```yaml

Make sure to add launch and config files respective to whatever build package you are using.

#### For Python

```py
(os.path.join('share', package_name, 'launch'), glob('launch/*.launch.py')),
(os.path.join('share', package_name, 'config'), glob('config/*')),
```

#### For C++

```text
install(DIRECTORY
        launch
        config
        DESTINATION $share/{PROJECT_NAME}
)
```

If all is placed correctly, we should be able to receive our old map. From there onwards, you want to configure your RVIZ settings with these below:

- `map`: Environment
- `TF`: Frames of the robot
- `Robot Model`: Robot structure (uses URDF model)
- `Laser Scan`: Estimate of robot position relative to actual map
- `Pose with Covariance`: Status of the localization
- `Particle Cloud`: See the localization particle distribution

:::note
Particle cloud uses the reliability policy of best effort and not volatile. If you want to use these configs again, you can save them.
:::

We can use the `2D Pose Estimate` to tell our `AMCL` system to start localizing the robot. You want to put it at a rough estimate of where the robot is so the algorithm can estimate roughly from the initial state. This'll start publishing the transform between `map` and `odom` topics respectively. When we say transform, it means relationship. The map and odom data are independent from oen another, but there is a mathematical relationship between them using AMCL, and can be used to "localize" our robot's position from these data. That's because we have laser scan (environment scanning) and odometry (wheel/position).

If we start moving our robot, our estimation and localization starts to fit better.

:::info
For 2D Localization, we only need $(x,y, \theta)$ and are the variables used for setting the robot in the `map` frame. We can compute $(x,y,\theta)$ by using the AMCL.
The Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization algorithm uses particles to localize the robot. Each particle have their own coordinates, orientation value, and a weight. These weights are the likelihood of the particle being a good estimate of the robot's actual pose based on our sensor data. That means that if our weight is higher for a given particle, that particle is more likely to represent the robot's true pose. These particles are then re-sampled whenever the robot moves and with new sensor data, the higher likelihood particles remain and will converge over many iterations to the robot's true pose.

To get a good localization of our robot, we need to configure out AMCL node from our amcl_config.yaml. Below are the parameters and their respective categories.
